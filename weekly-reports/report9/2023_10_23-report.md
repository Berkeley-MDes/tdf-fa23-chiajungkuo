# Report 9 - 2023_10_23 - 2023_10_26 #
### *Chia-Jung, Kuo, Technology Design Foundation*

### Summary:

Last Thursday was the exciting project 2 video showcase. On Monday, we got started with building our own LLM model. 

---

### Project2 Presentation:
I had gone through so many things to this day! And every group's work was fantastic, and I was happy to see classmates from different backgrounds were demonstrating their talents, which was totally different from what I had seen in my undergrad's design program. 

---

### Introduction to ZeroWidth:
Luckily, I gained a basic knowledge of a LLM model from the lecture, or I'll have nothing else than blank in my mind since its a totally unfamiliar field to me. Then we went through the key functions of creating Intelligence and Knowledge Sets. 
I had my first langauge model as my schedule assistant and fed it with the schedule of TDF project3.

After adding this instruction, it could now respond to us with the given information.

### Speculations:
I felt so excited with the new tool to build a digital me. I've already imagined that one day I don't have to write the design description words by words by myself, and instead I can just give some prompts and have myself to elaborate them. For this project deliver, I'm thinking doing an cover letter generator by feeding it my experiences.

Btw, recently I am working on the elaboration of project2! Some render pics:)
