### *Chia-Jung, Kuo, Technology Design Foundation*

### Summary:
This week I made use of the skill of *Solid Difference* in Grasshopper and modified it with my own aesthetic, and then I put it into 3D printing. Hope the result is graet because it takes a long time to print and hope that I can make it on time :cold_sweat:.

### Ideation & Sketch:
When I saw the 3D model first time, I feel that there are many part of it can be remove but still maintaining its function in order to save material (experience from an industrial design student striving for cutting down on cost with 3D printings :relieved:) Additionally, I learned the skill of *Solid Difference* on last week's course, so it would be useful for me to "sculpt and chop down" some materials and also to bring my design into it. 

Based on the form of the original phone stand and the skills I have now in Grasshopper, I came up with the idea with an iceberg. What if I subtract several chunks and make it a series of icebergs?

### Grasshopper:
Begin with revision, I adjusted the original model to fit my iPhone 13.

Then I dealt with the top of the model, which is too flat for an iceberg. As the result, I adjusted the "cane truncate" of originally model, and instead of putting it into *Solid Intersection*, I made it the object to be subtracted. First I inserted the *Rotated geometry* function, used the YZ plane penetrating the centroid of cylinder and put on a slider for angle adjustment (note: we can always use the function in *Trig* to convert amounts between radius and angle!)

With similar methods, I extruded the surface, rotate and move it to a proper overlapping, and then subtract it from the cone of the previous step to create the section of an iceberg.

Now I got an phone stand of the iceberg form after times of the subtraction step.

What's more, it can further generate the series of different icebergs by simply playing with the parameters!

### 3D printing:
For the best effect of an iceberg, I used the *clear resin* of the Form3 printer.

### Reflection:
Although I've adjusted the phone stand with Grasshopper, it was still not the ideal answer of **computational design** in my mind; they were too random, organic and "irrational".
