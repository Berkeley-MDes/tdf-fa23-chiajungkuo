### *Chia-Jung, Kuo, Technology Design Foundation*

### Summary:
This week I made use of the skill of *Solid Difference* in Grasshopper and modified it with my own aesthetic, and then I put it into 3D printing. Hope the result is great because it takes a long time to print and hope that I can make it on time :cold_sweat:.

### Ideation & Sketch:
When I saw the 3D model first time, I felt that many parts could be removed but still maintained the function to save material (experience from an industrial design student striving to cut down on cost with 3D printings :relieved:) Additionally, I learned the skill of *Solid Difference* on last week's course, so it would be useful for me to "sculpt and chop down" some materials and also to bring my design into it. 

Based on the form of the original phone stand and the skills I have now in Grasshopper, I came up with the idea of an iceberg. What if I subtract several chunks and make it a series of icebergs?

### Grasshopper:
Begin with revision, I adjusted the original model to fit my iPhone 13.

Then I dealt with the top of the model, which is too flat for an iceberg. As a result, I adjusted the "cane truncate" of the original model, and instead of putting it into *Solid Intersection*, I made it the object to be subtracted. First I inserted the *Rotated geometry* function, used the YZ plane penetrating the centroid of the cylinder, and put on a slider for angle adjustment (note: we can always use the function in *Trig* to convert amounts between radius and angle!)

With similar methods, I extruded the surface, rotated and moved it to a proper overlapping, and then subtracted it from the cone of the previous step to create the section of an iceberg.

Now I got an phone stand of the iceberg form after times of the subtraction step.

What's more, it can further generate a series of different icebergs by simply playing with the parameters!

### 3D printing:
For the best effect of an iceberg, I used the *clear resin* of the Form3 printer.

### Reflection:
Although I've adjusted the phone stand with Grasshopper, it was still not the ideal answer of **computational design** in my mind; they were too random, organic, and "irrational", and I believe the reason is that I was still modifying the appearance, not the design itself -- in other words, my thinking still around **singular objects**. I wanted to redesign the structure from the beginning. However, I found it hard to modify it based on the original model because every node is involved with each other. Next time when **designing the whole system**, I feel that I should begin with plain canva and search for the other user pain points and scenarios for the next project.
