### *Chia-Jung, Kuo, Technology Design Foundation*

### Summary:
This week I designed three coffee dripper and printed one of them for the project 1. 
Playing with Grasshopper a lot, I've gotten started with it!

### Ideation & Sketch:
Last week, I only modified some paremeters and subtracted something from the original file, but didn't do much creation. Thus, for this week, I'd like to design it from zero to one.
The artifact I chose to redesign with computational design are coffee drippers. Since I moved to the US, I was annoyed that I don’t have my own coffee dripper. Additionally, brewing coffee has long been an art and mystery, every slight details matters in making coffee. I’m so curious about what might different patterns on the dripper change the flavor of coffee, since there’s no clear and specific guideline or data for people to connect those patterns with flavors, but all depending on abstract description. 

**How might we quantify these physical variables so that we can brew for a more ideal coffee flavor?**

### Grasshopper:
1. Diamond Dripper

For the first model, I began with the geometry of the whole dripper and customized it for my cup. I used one unique plug-in that can generate those diamond-panel shape. The most challenging part for this model was how to union breps into one closed Polysurface. It depent on how parameters of geometry affects each other, and the skill of subtraction to get the shape I wanted.

2. Rib Dripper

The diamond dripper was born, but I wasn’t satisfied with it because I didn’t experience the process of making the pattern. So for the next two one I’d like to challenge myself of it. The rib dripper is one of the most common dripper, and was also really easy to made by projecting one line to the surface, creating tubes and then generated an array. To make it more practical, I added a bunch details of restriction about the start points and the end points of the ribs so that it could always generate reasonable results.

3. Wavy Dripper

For the wavy one, I created the patterns by slicing the surface layers by layers, adjust each section through the Graph Mapper to generate a smooth and sprial appearance. It was the last but the most challenging one since it relied on the deeper knowledge of lists and data structurs in Grasshopper, but now I got started with those advanced Grasshopper skills.

### 3D printing:

I printed one of the model by SLA printing, but it would be better if I was able to access to the printing materials that are more heat-resisting and suitable for contact with food. So actually I preferred to view this model as a structral prototype. However, it inspired me to propose this new way to design and evaluate coffee drippers.

### Reflection:

With these model, we can measure the relation of patterns, water flows and flavors more precisely and create variations for each kind of flavor. Furthermore, based on the database, we may be able to have customized and AI- generated drippers by simply entering ideal preferences. As for users, it would both become easier for beginners to explore the world of coffee and provide chances for baristas to maintain the quality of their ART works more accurately.
