### *Chia-Jung, Kuo, Technology Design Foundation*

### Summary:
This week I designed three coffee drippers and printed one of them for project 1. 
Playing with Grasshopper a lot, I've gotten started with it!

### Ideation:

Last week, I only modified some parameters and subtracted something from the original file, but didn't do much creation. Thus, for this week, I'd like to design it from zero to one.The artifact I chose to redesign with computational design is a coffee dripper. Since I moved to the US, I have been annoyed that I don’t have my coffee dripper. Additionally, brewing coffee has long been an art and mystery, every slight detail matters in making coffee. I’m so curious about how might different patterns on the dripper change the flavor of coffee since there’s no clear and specific guideline or data for people to connect those patterns with flavors, but it all depends on abstract descriptions. 

**How might we quantify these physical variables so that we can brew for a more ideal coffee flavor?**

### Grasshopper:
1. Diamond Dripper

For the first model, I began with the geometry of the whole dripper and customized it for my cup. I used one unique plug-in that can generate those diamond-panel shapes. The most challenging part of this model was how to union breps into one closed polysurface. It depends on how parameters of geometry affect each other, and the skill of subtraction to get the shape I wanted.

2. Rib Dripper

The diamond dripper was born, but I wasn’t satisfied with it because I hadn’t experienced the process of making the pattern. So for the next two, I’d like to challenge myself to it. The rib dripper is one of the most common drippers and was also really easy to make by projecting one line to the surface, creating tubes, and then generating an array. To make it more practical, I added a bunch of details of restrictions about the start points and the end points of the ribs so that it could always generate reasonable results.

3. Wavy Dripper

For the wavy one, I created the patterns by slicing the surface layers by layers and adjusting each section through the Graph Mapper to generate a smooth and sprial appearance. It was the last but the most challenging one since it relied on the deeper knowledge of lists and data structures in Grasshopper, but now I have started with those advanced Grasshopper skills.

### 3D printing:

I printed one of the model by SLA printing, but it would be better if I was able to access the printing materials that are more heat-resisting and suitable for contact with food. So actually I preferred to view this model as a structural prototype. However, it inspired me to propose this new way to design and evaluate coffee drippers.

### Reflection:

With these models, we can measure the relation of patterns, water flows, and flavors more precisely and create variations for each kind of flavor. Furthermore, based on the database, we may be able to have customized and AI-generated drippers by simply entering ideal preferences. As for users, it would both become easier for beginners to explore the world of coffee and provide chances for baristas to maintain the quality of their ART works more accurately.
