### *Chia-Jung, Kuo, Technology Design Foundation*

### Summary:
This week I designed three coffee dripper and printed one of them for the project 1. 
Playing with Grasshopper a lot, I've gotten started with it!

### Ideation & Sketch:
Last week, I only modified some paremeters and subtracted something from the original file, but didn't do much creation. Thus, for this week, I'd like to design it from zero to one.
The artifact I chose to redesign with computational design are coffee drippers. Since I moved to the US, I was annoyed that I don’t have my own coffee dripper. Additionally, brewing coffee has long been an art and mystery, every slight details matters in making coffee. I’m so curious about what might different patterns on the dripper change the flavor of coffee, since there’s no clear and specific guideline or data for people to connect those patterns with flavors, but all depending on abstract description. 

**How might we quantify these physical variables so that we can brew for a more ideal coffee flavor?**

### Grasshopper:
1. Diamond Dripper

For the first model, I began with the geometry of the whole dripper and customized it for my cup. I used one unique plug-in that can generate those diamond-panel shape. The most challenging part for this model was how to union breps into one closed Polysurface. It depent on how parameters of geometry affects each other, and the skill of subtraction to get the shape I wanted.

2. Rib Dripper

The diamond dripper was born, but I wasn’t satisfied with it because I didn’t experience the process of making the pattern. So for the next two one I’d like to challenge myself of it. The rib dripper is one of the most common dripper, and was also really easy to made by projecting one line to the surface, creating tubes and then generated an array. To make it more practical, I added a bunch details of restriction about the start points and the end points of the ribs so that it could always generate reasonable results.

3. Wavy Dripper

For the wavy one, I created the patterns by slicing the surface layers by layers, adjust each section through the Graph Mapper to generate a smooth and sprial appearance. It was the last but the most challenging one since it relied on the deeper knowledge of lists and data structurs in Grasshopper, but now I got started with those advanced Grasshopper skills.

### 3D printing:
For the ideal effect of an iceberg, I used the *clear resin* of the Form3 printer.

The stand with my phone :arrow_down:

When put under the sunlight, the clear resin would refract various colors.

### Reflection:
Although I've adjusted the phone stand with Grasshopper, it was still not the ideal answer of **computational design** in my mind; they were too random, organic, and "irrational", and I believe the reason is that I was still modifying the appearance, not the design itself -- in other words, my thinking still around **singular objects**. I wanted to redesign the structure from the beginning. However, I found it hard to modify it based on the original model because every node is involved with each other. Next time when **designing the whole system**, I feel that I should begin with plain canva and search for the other user pain points and scenarios for the next project.
