# Report 1 - Week of 08/21/2023 #
### Chia-Jung, Kuo, Technology Design Foundation

### Summary:
This week we started a phonestand project for the introduction to Rhino, Grasshopper, and physical manufacturing. This time I tried laser cutting on my own for the first time and learned a lesson :disappointed_relieved:. It will be elaborated in the following paragraph.


### Rhino & Grasshopper
Since I have little experience using Grasshopper before, I quickly go started with those files. 







### Laser Cutting
After exporting the 2D file to Ai, I went to Makerspace and looked for the material with appropriate thickness which is 6mm. Luckily, I found it in the scrap bin! I operated the laser cutter without second thought, as I thought that everything went good

If you use this format, you might want to link back to the main [README.md](../README.md) like so!
