### Summary:
This Monday, we had a gallery display of project 4 proposals and there were many creative ideas that inspired me so much. 

### Speculation for project4:
After seeing other's proposals and also the thoughts on industry researching these days, I feel that there can be more possibilities to combine with AI comparing with my original project. Also, my previous partner is going to team up with me again, and her idea about data interpretation is interesting, so I'm thinking to mix both of our proposals to see how can we make it best within the short time.
