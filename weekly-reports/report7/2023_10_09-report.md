# Report 7 - 2023_10_95 - 2023_10_09 #
### *Chia-Jung, Kuo, Technology Design Foundation*

### Summary:

This week, my team worked on concept development and prototyping. We encountered some technical obstacles but after the discussion with Shm (**Shout out to Shm!! U R THE LIFESAVER!!!!**), we change the limitation of Photon into a expandable module design, which is so exciting!

### Concept development:
Our topic was originally related to braille education. We wanted to design a game board that can sense the placed blocks that indicated different braille characters and tell whether the learner spells it right or not. So we needed each block had its own unique identification. The technique of RFID came to my mind, and we started testing it.

### RFID Testing:
The components we bought was RC522. Since it was my first time using it, I mainly followed [this tutorial](https://www.hackster.io/ingo-lohs/rfid-kit-particle-photon-a-first-introduction-9544f1) but kept failing at the beginning. After consulting with Shm (Thanks again Shm I LOVE U), we found out that the problems was the function of each pin. Since the tutorial is for Photon, the same wiring couldn't be applied to Photon 2 since several functions of pins on Photon 2 are quite different. So we spent a lot of time remapping it and hopefully it worked. But I have to say it was a ridiculous version updating, **how can Particle make their scarse online resources even useless?** There is no logic and rules to follow the changes of pins, they even have a D15 pin BETWEEN D16 and D17!!! What were they thinking about???

### Connecting Multiple RFID - a failure but a chance!

### Speculations:

We felt eager to make this prototype in a board game kit, so that learning braille is no longer a unpopular area, but an intersting gaming language as well as the facilitation of interaction with visually impaired children.
