### *Chia-Jung, Kuo, Technology Design Foundation*

### Summary:

This week, my team worked on concept development and prototyping. We encountered some technical obstacles but after the discussion with Shm (**Shout out to Shm!! U R THE LIFESAVER!!!!**), we change the limitation of Photon into a expandable module design, which is so exciting!

### Speculations:

We felt eager to make this prototype in a board game kit, so that learning braille is no longer a unpopular area, but an intersting gaming language as well as the facilitation of interaction with visually impaired children.
