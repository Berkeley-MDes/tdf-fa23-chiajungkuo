### *Chia-Jung, Kuo, Technology Design Foundation*

### Summary:

This week, my team worked on concept development and prototyping. We encountered some technical obstacles, but after the discussion with Shm (**Shout out to Shm!! You are the lifesaver!!!!**), we changed the limitation of Photon into an expandable module design, which is so exciting!

### Concept development:
Our topic was originally related to braille education. We wanted to design a game board that can sense the placed blocks that indicated different braille characters and tell whether the learner spells it correctly or not. So we needed each block to have its own unique identification. The technique of RFID came to my mind, and we started testing it.

### RFID Testing:
The components we bought were RC522. Since it was my first time using it, I mainly followed [this tutorial](https://www.hackster.io/ingo-lohs/rfid-kit-particle-photon-a-first-introduction-9544f1) but kept failing at the beginning. After consulting with Shm (Thanks again, Shm. I love you.), we found out that the problem was the function of each pin. Since the tutorial is for Photon, the same wiring couldn't be applied to Photon 2 since several functions of pins on Photon 2 are quite different. So we spent a lot of time remapping it, and hopefully, it worked. But I have to say, it was a ridiculous version update. How could Particle make their already scarce online resources even more useless? There seems to be no logic or rules to follow in the changes of pins. They even have a D15 pin BETWEEN D16 and D17!!! What were they thinking about?

### Connecting Multiple RFID - a failure but a chance!

For connecting the second RC522 to the Photon 2, we found that each pin should be connected separately and would occupy all the available sets on Photon 2's pins. But soon one idea came to my mind: What if we make our design modular, and each module just contains one microcontroller and two readers and can be connected? So the learner can attach as many modules as they need. Also, the usage can be extended to not only braille learning but also learning how to place things in order.

### Making two Photon2s communicate:

We all felt excited about the new idea but soon got upset due to the strongly user-unfriendly operation of Photon 2. I was trying the Particle.publish() following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFXK7RvDT-Y&t=136s), but in this method, it requires the two devices to be under the same account. So I unclaimed one of the devices on one account and tried to set it up into the other account but kept failing. The error message is: "We weren't able to create your new product; the problem occurred on our end. Please try again." 

![Why you treated like that, Particle](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-chiajungkuo/blob/main/weekly-reports/report7/2023_10_09_error.png)

When I went back to bind the device to my original account, the same circumstance happened, and now my devices completely became orphans.

I hope we will get through it after the office hour with TJ. So frustrated. ðŸ˜”

### Speculations:
I know that there must be several considerations for this course, but in my opinion, using Photon 2 wasn't the best choice for learning a microcontroller, especially for a lot of beginners in the cohort. The biggest reason is that there is almost no resource or tutorial for Photon 2, and, even worse, the resources of other devices (even the Photon 1) you found cannot be applied to it as well. The original design of Photon 2 is still not intuitive enough for people to learn without any tutorial, which makes the process so helpless and frustrating.
