### *Chia-Jung, Kuo, Technology Design Foundation*

### Summary:

Last Thursday, we moved on to work with Visual Studio and tried a different way to flash the code into the Photon2. In the lecture of this Monday, we got better knowledge about how fantastic a digital ecosystem product could be. Then on Tuesday, our group started discussing the specific speculation of our topic.

### Project 2 discussion:

Our original topic is *Tangible Prototyping for Interactive Programming Education*. Since all of the teammates are interested in designing for visually impaired children and educational topics, we sticked to the both core concept and tried to think about more possibilities that are not only for programming. Then we found this intriguing reference [LEGOÂ® Braille Bricks](https://legobraillebricks.com/) and tried to extend this idea of braille education. 

We came up with sounds and pronunciations, which we thought they can impress the visually impaired students and also boost their communication abilities. Additionally, we hoped our concept could encourage more people without diabilities to learn how to interact with visully impaired people by learning braille together and even experience the life of them by wearing an eyemask.

### Speculations:

Although it was always stressful that squeezing out ideas in a limited time (Fun fact, almost all of my courses have asked me to do so in this semester), I found it really helpful to think outside of the box, and I quite like the process of "Idea Trading", since it allowed me to consider topics I never think about and collect cohorts' precious knowledge and insights in an efficient way. For example, my first choice of the topic -- *Tangible Prototyping for Interactive Programming Education: Empowering the Visually Impaired* is totally a brand new field for me. Actually the word *inclusive design* had never entered my mind. But now I feel eager to explore more with this topic and build something tangible in this project!
