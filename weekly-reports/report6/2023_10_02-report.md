### *Chia-Jung, Kuo, Technology Design Foundation*

### Summary:

Last Thursday, we moved on to work with Visual Studio and tried a different way to flash the code into the Photon2. In the lecture of this Monday, we got better knowledge about how fantastic a digital ecosystem product could be. Then on Tuesday, our group started discussing the specific speculation of our topic.

### Project 2 discussion:

Our original topic is *Tangible Prototyping for Interactive Programming Education*. Since all of the teammates are interested in designing for visually impaired children and educational topics, we sticked to the both core concept and tried to think about more possibilities that are not only for programming. Then we found this intriguing reference [LEGOÂ® Braille Bricks](https://legobraillebricks.com/) and tried to extend this idea of braille education. 

We came up with sounds and pronunciations, which we thought they can impress the visually impaired students and also boost their communication abilities. So we would develope ideas based on the ref and add the function of playing the pronunciation of the words. Additionally, we hoped our concept could encourage more people without diabilities to learn how to interact with visully impaired people by learning braille together and even experience the life of them by wearing an eyemask.

### Speculations:

We felt eager to make this prototype in a board game kit, so that learning braille is no longer a unpopular area, but an intersting gaming language as well as the facilitation of interaction with visually impaired children.
