### Speculations:
I felt so excited with the new tool to build a digital me. I've already imagined that one day I don't have to write the design description words by words by myself, and instead I can just give some prompts and have myself to elaborate them. For this project deliver, I'm thinking doing an cover letter generator by feeding it my experiences.

Btw, recently I am working on the elaboration of project2! Some render pics:)
