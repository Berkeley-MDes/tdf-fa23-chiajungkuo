# Report 1 - 2023_08_21 - 2023_08_28 #
### *Chia-Jung, Kuo, Technology Design Foundation*

### Summary:
This week we started a phone stand project for the introduction to Rhino, Grasshopper, and physical manufacturing. This time I tried laser cutting on my own for the first time and learned a lesson :disappointed_relieved:.

### Rhino & Grasshopper
Since I have little experience using Grasshopper before, I quickly go started with those files. I adjusted different parameters and observe corresponding changes.

Comparing to my product design experience before, procedural modeling significantly decrease the time and effort of repeating monotonous steps when revising product details especially for ergonomics design. Take my previous project as an example, we were designing an electrical wheelchair, every time I'd like to adjust the width of chair, I had to repeat drawing lines on top-view/side-view, Sweep2, Trim, Fillet, Boolean Union....But with Grasshopper, the variation is made by computation and I can easily compare the differences of each procedural model, which is more accurate and efficient as well.

Additionally, using Grasshopper can take fabrication and other constrains into consider before making physical models, which will reduce mistakes made by manual inspection (e.g. overlapping, assembly, naked edges and thickness) and increase successful manufacture. 

In this scenario of filming vidoes, what is important and should also be observed is the parameters of camera --**focal point, focal length, depth of field, distortion** and so on. Each of it will influence the quality of video. More, I think **including material thickness as an adjustable parameter** as well will increase the flexibility in material selection.

As for evaluations, composition and focusing are decisive factors of a successful video as I mentioned above. We can use The Rule of Thirds as the fundemantal assessment by measuring the distance/times of the subjects deviating from those reference points.

With advanced technology of AI and computer vision, we can further collect and analyze the composition of those most viewed videos of simmilar topics to generate adivice about what attracts audience most.

### Laser Cutting
After exporting the 2D file to Ai, I went to Makerspace and looked for the material with appropriate thickness which is 6mm. Luckily, I found it in the scrap bin! I operated the laser cutter without second thought, as I thought that everything went good, something unexpected happened.

I followed the training to adjust laser power by measuring the accurate thickness of material. However, it was not cut through for the first time, and I did a bad decision of CUTTING IT AGAIN AND AGAIN. Unfortunately, even though I cut it for three times and some of the edges were almost burnt, those parts were still so hard to seperate that I needed to use a box cutter to post-process it.

In this picture, it is obvious that the cut route is really wide and inaccurate. One design specialist passed by and asked me whether did I do the test cut first, and I realized I forgot to do the most important step.

Although it worked eventually, I'm still unsatified with the result, since the edges are burnt to be rugged and burn marks are everywhere on the surface. The experience allowed me to learn a lesson deeply -- **I should always do a test cut before laser cutting!**

### Reflections:
Computational design has long been the field that I'm eager to explore. Combined with my previous experience of product design and making use of Rhino, I'd like to set goals that I've never achieve before in this project, such as mass production, recursive pattern, and so on. 

One of the unexpected harvest is that I talked to and made new friends with the cohorts by helping them with Rhino, and I'm looking forward to interact with people of different abilities from me in the upcoming projects. 

## Keep going as this broccoli!
