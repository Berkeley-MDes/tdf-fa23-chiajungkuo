# Report 7 - 2023_10_05 - 2023_10_09 #
### *Chia-Jung, Kuo, Technology Design Foundation*

### Summary:

This week I've gone through soooo many things!
First, we solve the problem I mentioned last week about the communication between two Photon2s, then I created sound feedbacks with the DFplayer successfully, and finally completed the whole prototyping.

### 2 Photon2's communication:
It was comfirmed that we have to make the two device belong to the same account for them to communicate. After seeking for TJ's (and also ChatGPT's...lol) we successfully boung them to the same account and make them commmunicate! However, since out prototype needs to transfer data, I tried the Particle.variable() function but is didn't work. So I looked up to the documents and found that : *It's not possible to directly read a variable from another device, even on the same account.*
Great job Particle! How can you make your product so worthless? But anyway, I used the publish and subscribe functions to achieve the same effect, but the usage was quite limited and not making much sense. Feeling so disappointed to Photon2 again.

### DFPlayer:
DFplayer is just like the DJ of a digital prototype, it can play the tracks in the SD card correspond to the instruction the microcontroller gives. Since I could hardly find any case that connect Photon2 to the DFplayer, I communicated with ChatGPT and also looked up to my previous codes. Not only I should remap the pins, but also attach it to an external power supply because the DFplayer needs 3.7V~5V (but the Li-ion battery couldn't drive it either, I didn't know why.) After tesing for hours or hours, the first successful module was born:

### Connecting Multiple RFID - a failure but a chance!

For connecting the second RC522 to the Photon 2, we found that each pin should be connected separately and would occupy all the available sets on Photon 2's pins. But soon one idea came to my mind: What if we make our design modular, and each module just contains one microcontroller and two readers and can be connected? So the learner can attach as many modules as they need. Also, the usage can be extended to not only braille learning but also learning how to place things in order.

### Making two Photon2s communicate:

We all felt excited about the new idea but soon got upset due to the strongly user-unfriendly operation of Photon 2. I was trying the Particle.publish() following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFXK7RvDT-Y&t=136s), but in this method, it requires the two devices to be under the same account. So I unclaimed one of the devices on one account and tried to set it up into the other account but kept failing. The error message is: "We weren't able to create your new product; the problem occurred on our end. Please try again." 

![Why you treated like that, Particle](https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-chiajungkuo/blob/main/weekly-reports/report7/2023_10_09_error.png)

When I went back to bind the device to my original account, the same circumstance happened, and now my devices completely became orphans.

I hope we will get through it after the office hour with TJ. So frustrated. ðŸ˜”

### Speculations:
I know that there must be several considerations for this course, but in my opinion, using Photon 2 wasn't the best choice for learning a microcontroller, especially for a lot of beginners in the cohort. The biggest reason is that there is almost no resource or tutorial for Photon 2, and, even worse, the resources of other devices (even the Photon 1) you found cannot be applied to it as well. The original design of Photon 2 is still not intuitive enough for people to learn without any tutorial, which makes the process so helpless and frustrating.
