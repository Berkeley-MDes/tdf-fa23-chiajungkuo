# Report 8 - 2023_10_12 - 2023_10_16 #
### *Chia-Jung, Kuo, Technology Design Foundation*

### Summary:

This week I've gone through soooo many things!
First, we solve the problem I mentioned last week about the communication between two Photon2s, then I created sound feedbacks with the DFplayer successfully, and finally completed the whole prototyping.

### 2 Photon2's communication:
It was comfirmed that we have to make the two device belong to the same account for them to communicate. After seeking for TJ's (and also ChatGPT's...lol) we successfully boung them to the same account and make them commmunicate! However, since out prototype needs to transfer data, I tried the Particle.variable() function but is didn't work. So I looked up to the documents and found that : *It's not possible to directly read a variable from another device, even on the same account.*
Great job Particle! How can you make your product so worthless? But anyway, I used the publish and subscribe functions to achieve the same effect, but the usage was quite limited and not making much sense. Feeling so disappointed to Photon2 again.

### DFPlayer:
DFplayer is just like the DJ of a digital prototype, it can play the tracks in the SD card correspond to the instruction the microcontroller gives. Since I could hardly find any case that connect Photon2 to the DFplayer, I communicated with ChatGPT and also looked up to my previous codes. Not only I should remap the pins, but also attach it to an external power supply because the DFplayer needs 3.7V~5V (but the Li-ion battery couldn't drive it either, I didn't know why.) After tesing for hours or hours, the first successful module was born: (I was going to cry)

### Sound feedbacks through communication
I tested whether I could combine the two abilities mentioned above, and it hardly worked but still not very stable.

### Speculations:
I think I like the concept of our project a lot and I indeed want to dig into it more until the end of the semester, but the limitation of exchanging data really bother me. Also I feel like the Photon2's ability to process complex serial data transportaion So I'm thinking is there any better microcontroller that can achieve the better effect?
