# Report 4 - 2023_09_14 - 2023_09_18 #
### *Chia-Jung, Kuo, Technology Design Foundation*

### Summary:

Last Thursday, we had a group presentation and popped out comments and feedback for each other, which came to an end for Project 1.
Then I began doing the setup and got the MAC address of my device to connect to Berkeley IoT Wi-Fi.

### Reflection on Project 1 Presentation:

I found the video presentation really helpful and effective especially for complex projects that need a lot of storytelling and visual materials. It also prevented designers from stammering or doing lengthy speeches and then ruining their work. Designers could show their design flow with a time-based medium thoroughly as well. Additionally, the form to gather cohorts' feedback was super efficient although my finger was almost burnt out. Everything became worthwhile after I saw the comments from my classmates, and I got motivated to perform better in the next projects!

### Photon2 Set up:

Since I have little experience with microcontrollers (Arduino and Raspberry Pie, but I think the Photon2 is kind of like a mixture of them), it seemed to be not that unfamiliar to me.

Following the [tutorial](https://github.com/loopstick/Photon2_Tutorial), I first plugged in the Photon2 controller and completed updating, naming, and connecting to Wi-Fi.

After that, I flashed the code that would "communicate" to the Photon2 and retrieve the MAC address through a USB serial debug log for me, which I should further use for registration in the Berkeley ioT network.

I tried to "communicate" with my controller more, so I did the Hello World practice.

### Workbench Installation:

I checked out the schedule next time that we will do advanced practices with local/cloud workbench, so I decided to install it first. However, it showed these error messages no matter how many times I tried. 

<img width="400" alt="Error message" src="https://github.com/Berkeley-MDes/tdf-fa23-chiajungkuo/blob/main/weekly-reports/report4/2023_09_19_setup-07.jpg">

So I reached out to their error report platform and found [this alternative](https://community.particle.io/t/particle-workbench-installer-error-invalid-json-response/49152/2).

### Speculation:
Now I'm ready to explore the world of the digital ecosystem! I feel so excited about this topic and I can say that's why I came to Mdes. Can't wait to know more about the project and work on it.
