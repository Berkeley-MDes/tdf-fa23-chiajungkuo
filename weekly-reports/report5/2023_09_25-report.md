# Report 5 - 2023_09_21 - 2023_09_25 #
### *Chia-Jung, Kuo, Technology Design Foundation*

### Summary:

Last Thursday, we continued the settings of Photon2, connected it to the Berkeley ioT network and got started with sevearl basic circuits. 
On Monday, we had a small brainstorming workshop and generated ideas based on wide topics quickly before the guest lecture.

### Connecting Photon2 to external worlds:

This practice allowed me to construct and connect ideas between Photon2 and my previous experiences with Arduino. Basically, they are of the same structure, but have little differences on jargons and hardwares (i.e. the name of pins). With these practicess, now I had better knowledge with the functions and mechanism of Photon2.

### Speculations on Brainstorming Workshop:

Although it was always stressful that squeezing out ideas in a limited time (Fun fact, almost all of my courses have asked me to do so in this semester), I found it really helpful to think outside of the box, and I quite like the process of "Idea Trading", since it allowed me to consider topics I never think about and collect cohorts' precious knowledge and insights in an efficient way. For example, my first choice of the topic -- *Tangible Prototyping for Interactive Programming Education: Empowering the Visually Impaired* is totally a brand new field for me. Actually the word *inclusive design* had never entered my mind. But now I feel eager to explore more with this topic and build something tangible in this project!
