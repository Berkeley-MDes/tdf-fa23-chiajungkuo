# Report 5 - 2023_09_21 - 2023_09_25 #
### *Chia-Jung, Kuo, Technology Design Foundation*

### Summary:

Last Thursday, we continued the settings of Photon2, connected it to the Berkeley ioT network and got started with sevearl basic circuit. 
On Monday, we had a small brainstorming workshop and generated ideas based on wide  topics quickly before the presentation of the guest speaker.

### Connecting Photon2 to external worlds:

This practice allowed me to construct and connect ideas between Photon2 and my previous experience with Arduino. Basically, they are of the same structure, but have little differences on jargons and hardwares (i.e. the name of pins). With these practice, now I had better knowledge with the function and machenism of Photon2.

### Workbench Installation:

I checked out the schedule next time that we will do advanced practices with local/cloud workbench, so I decided to install it first. However, it showed these error messages no matter how many times I tried.

So I reached out to their error report platform and found [this alternative](https://community.particle.io/t/particle-workbench-installer-error-invalid-json-response/49152/2).

### Speculation:
Now I'm ready to explore the world of the digital ecosystem! I feel so excited about this topic and I can say that's why I came to Mdes. Can't wait to know more about the project and work on it.
