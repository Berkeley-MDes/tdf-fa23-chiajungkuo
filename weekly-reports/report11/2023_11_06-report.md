### *Chia-Jung, Kuo, Technology Design Foundation*

### Summary:
Last week, we had a small showcase about our project 3, and then began to think about how to move on to project4. 

### Project 3 presentation:
Since my unfamiliarity to LLM, I just finished the project with the most basic requirements. Much to my surprise, the feedbacks from folks really touched me and that is the first time I found this kind of feedback activity meaningful.

### Speculation for project4:
It's great that we have a scenario to think about how to make sure the techniques we have now and how to deliver it. I'm also looking forward to finding passionate partners.
